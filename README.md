An early experiment in the use of Redux with React Native. The app presents a list of topics associated with React, and when the user selects one, a description drops down (with spring animation).

It uses components from my earlier [ReactNativeAuth project](https://github.com/sleeplesseditor/ReactNativeAuth).
